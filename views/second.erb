<p>A musical instrument is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be a musical instrumentâ€”it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony.</p>
